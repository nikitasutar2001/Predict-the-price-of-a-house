# Predict-the-price-of-a-house
##Problem statement: 
    The goal is to understand the relationship between house features and how these variables affect the house price. Using more than one model, predict the price of the house using the given dataset. Please compare the accuracy of the models along with the drawbacks of each technique's assumptions before recommending the final prediction model.nts:
    This is a Regression problem, so applying the regression models such as
    
##Objectives:
    Predict the Price per sqft for each House.
    
##Performance Metric:
    Mean Absolute Error to know the absolute deference between Actual and Predicted values
  
##Machine Learning Objective and Constraints:
    This is a Regression problem, so applying the regression models such as:
    * Linear Regression 
    * Support Vector Machine
    * Random Forest Regression
##Result:
    Random Forest Regression model is giving better accuracy as the mean absolute error is the least among all the other regressor models i.e. 0.14 approx.
